Project Concept: Magic the Gathering Mobile Play Tester

Description: Users will be able to build decks with cards imported from a database from the MTG API.
They will be able to play alone or against a a friend. For now the multiplayer will be restricted to
local players, but may be expanded to online play. The rules if magic are highly complex, and are 
influenced by individual cards. This detail will make maintainability difficult if we choose to enforce
all rules of gameplay. We will enforce minimal rules, but will allow the users to override any 
enforcements. This game will run on the honor system which will make online multiplayer difficult.
This app will be highly useful to players like myself he wish to test their new deck ideas.
